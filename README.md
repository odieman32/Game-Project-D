# 🔫 Gunner 7 – Third-Person Shooter Prototype

**Gunner 7** is a **third-person shooter prototype** built in Unity to explore and showcase my progress in **3D character animation**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

> **"This project is a game prototype called *Gunner 7*. This project was made to improve my animation skills for characters. I learned more about animation blend trees and the Unity animation system."**

This prototype was developed as part of my continued learning in **3D game development**, specifically focusing on:

- 🎥 Third-person camera systems  
- 🧍 Character movement and animation  
- 🔫 Basic shooting mechanics  
- 🎮 Smooth transitions between idle, walking, running, and shooting states
